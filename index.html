<h1> Motivation </h1>

<p>Yelp (yelp.com) is one of the most popular food review website in USA. Although it has a huge list of data and users reviewing various restaurants, it faces the following drawbacks:</span></p>
<ol>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p>Lack of Visualizations on the website</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Text data/text reviews are generally difficult to read</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rating of the food in the restaurant is the mean rating of all the reviews for that particular restaurant. The drawback of this measure of analysis is that even if the recent food quality of a particular restaurant is much worse (leading to low rating over the last few months), it is offset by a big number of high ratings due to a cumulative rating of the restaurant over a period of 2-3 years. Hence, even if a restaurant has an overall 4.5 star rating, it might have got an average of 1.5 star rating over the last 2-3 months but users would still see the high rating of the restaurant due to a cumulative sum of reviews.</span></p>
